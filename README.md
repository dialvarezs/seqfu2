A general-purpose program to manipulate and parse information from FASTA/FASTQ files,
supporting gzipped input files.
Includes functions to *interleave* and *de-interleave* FASTQ files, to *rename*
sequences and to *count* and print *statistics* on sequence lengths.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Seqfu can be easily installed via Miniconda:

```bash
conda install -y -c conda-forge -c bioconda "seqfu>1.10"
```

### Build from source

Building the Nim programs alone would just require a `nimble build`, but this would leave out some other utilities.
There is a `make` (Makefile) building system. Since Nim is not so popular, I describe a full installation:

```bash
# Do you have building tools? You will need C and make, in Ubuntu:
sudo apt install build-essential

# Install zlib
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev

# Install Nim 2.0
curl https://nim-lang.org/choosenim/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/telatin/seqfu2

# Compile and test
cd seqfu2
make
make test

# All binaries are in bin (move them in a location in your $PATH)
```
