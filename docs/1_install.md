# Installation


## Install via Miniconda

The recommended installation method is via BioConda, if you have _conda_ installed ([how to install it](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)):

```
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda seqfu
```


## Pre-compiled binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are distributed with the [stable releases](https://github.com/telatin/qax/releases).
