# Utilities

All these programs are automatically installed with SeqFu, but are accessible via
independent binaries rather than the core tool _seqfu_:

### SeqFu utilities

{% include list.liquid %}

### Other utilities

Some tools required by [Dadaist2](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/dadaist2) are
written using the SeqFu templates and routines, and being SeqFu a dependency of Dadaist2 they
are shipped with SeqFu, and they have the `dadaist2-` prefix.
