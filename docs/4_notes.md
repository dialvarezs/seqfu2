# About SeqFu

This page contains a small selection of examples for getting started using **seqfu**.

The main parsing library is `klib.nim` by Heng Li ([lh3/biofast](https://github.com/lh3/biofast)), that provides good performances.

For some utilities the *readfq* library has been used ([andreas-wilm/nimreadfq](https://github.com/andreas-wilm/nimreadfq)). This is based on the
C version of Heng Li's parsed, wrapped in an object oriented module.
